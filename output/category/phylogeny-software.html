            <article>
                <p>Some of you may be familiar with <a href="http://mesquiteproject.org/packages/tsv/">TreeSetViz</a>. This is a software developed by a team of computer scientists and biologists working in tandem to make it easier to view the treespace explored by an MCMC run. You can read the original paper <a href="http://www.zo.utexas.edu/faculty/antisense/papers/Hillisetal2005TreeSpace.pdf">here</a>. It's a very useful piece of software that has, regrettably, fallen off a bit in terms of maintenance. I recently needed to use it, and decided to put some instructions here because I will forget how I accomplished my work, and for some reason, finding things on the internet is presisantly easier than on my computer or desk.</p>
<p><em>Task:</em> Overlay the output of two MCMC runs on top of each other, and color points by which run produces them. </p>
<p>First, you need a copy of Mesquite. I am on Ubuntu which, while I love it, has some quirks. So I needed to install <a href="http://mesquiteproject.wikispaces.com/History+of+Mesquite">Mesquite 2.72</a>. </p>
<p>Second, open Mesquite. If you're on a Mac or Windows, this might be as simple as clicking the Mesquite icon. Ubuntu didn't make an icon. So I navigated into the folder in the terminal, and typed:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">.</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">run_mesquite</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">sh</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It will then boot for a little bit. Mesquite has a lot of cool features, and you can see the default modules as it loads.</p>
<p>Once Mesquite has booted, open the <em>File</em> menu. Navigate to <em>Check for Notices/Installs</em>. A dialog box will pop up. In it, enter:
http://mesquiteproject.org/packages/tsv/install.xml</p>
<p>to install TreeSetViz. Restart your computer completely.</p>
<p>Once rebooted, reopen Mesquite. You may want to change the amount of memory Mesquite has available to it. To look at 1000 trees, I started Mesquite as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>   <span class="n">java</span>  <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Xmx2500M</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Xss4m</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Djava</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">library</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">lib</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">cp</span> <span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">mesquite</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Mesquite</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Once Mesquite is open, initialize a new project. I initialized my project with the consensus topology from one of my MCMC runs so I could be sure that I had the correct taxon information. I did this by chooing <em>File</em> &gt; <em>Open New File</em> and navigating to my tree.</p>
<p>Now, you can add your tree samples. If you've correctly opened a file, you should now have a Project Window. From the Project Window, you can do all kinds of tree-based operations. Under <em>Taxa&amp;Trees</em>, choose <em>Make New Trees Block From</em> &gt; <em>Sample Trees From Separate Nexus File</em>. Choose you nexus file. It will count all the trees for a minute, then ask how many you'd like to load. I used 500. It will then ask if any trees should be skipped; I skipped the burnin period.</p>
<p>Repeat this for your second sample.</p>
<p>Now is where things get a little tricky. Under <em>Taxa&amp;Trees</em>, choose <em>TreeSetVisualization</em>. A window will pop up asking which trees to use. Choose <em>Concatenate Trees from Two Sources</em>. Select your first block of trees and click OK. Then do the same for the second. TSV will now ask you for some TSV-specific info about consensus trees and between-tree metrics. Choose whichever makes sense for your data. I used a majority-rule consensus tree and Robinson-Foulds as the between tree metric.</p>
<p>TSV will now calculate the metrics between trees. This will take a minute.</p>
<p>Once everything is loaded in, click 'Start MDS' to run the scaling described in the Hillis paper. Now you have a set of trees, all of which are scaled uniformly.  But you want to see which run is which!</p>
<p>So, under <em>Visualization</em>, click <em>Color Points By</em>. This is what lost me for a while: you want the <em>Attached Value</em> option. It colors by which tree source each tree comes from.</p>
<p>That's it! Easy!</p>
