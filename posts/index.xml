&lt;p&gt;This week, I taught a Software Carpentry Workshop with Fan Yang and Auriel Fournier for intermediate learners in mechanical engineering. It had been a while since I worked with intermediate learners, but I think we all had a really good time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What worked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Class size: This was one of the smaller SWC workshops I've [AMW] been a part of. We had about 27 learners, and three instructors. All the instructors had some proficiency in each topic. This was a very good ratio, and we were able to help learners effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Class composition: The learners knew each other and felt comfortable asking their classmates for help. This meant that more advanced students were confirming their own knowledge through helping others, and less advanced students never had to wait for an instructor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extra time with git: Intermediate learners need less of the syntax of languages and commands, and more information on the best practices. Spending more time on doing a merge, and doing a hands-on example gives them more practice with the skills that will be important in their development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About 15 minutes into the Unix lesson I [AMVF] realized that for many in the room this was review, and they seemed bored. This wasn't the best foot to start the workshop on since I didn't want to lose them right away, so I trimmed the lesson down as we went to make sure everyone got the base level but we didn't bore the others. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What didn't:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make: The Windows Installer wasn't working for Make. Our audience was about two-thirds Windows. So I [AMW] wrote an emergency lesson to plug the gap. I pulled some material from the UT biocomputing course [link] and some from the Data Carpentry Data as Read-Only lesson. The result was a lesson where we talked a bit about the os module and creating directories on the fly in Python, data management, and importing your own scripts as modules. I think this was useful, and would love to work with a partner to make this into a more complete lesson. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying to go off-script: I [AMW] am just not that good at saying 'Hey, good question, let's try that!'. I should say 'Hey, good question, come see me after.' I know I should.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The room. I should have gone over to check out the power situation. We didn't have enough outlets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I [AMVF] had some major computer problems right before the workshop and used a friend's laptop to teach from, and didn't spend enough time checking to make sure I had everything installed, which caused a few hiccups. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I [AMVF] should have spent more time reviewing general expressions so I could explain the WHY of the example I showed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Reproducibility and Cutting Yourself Some Slack</title><link href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/parity-paper.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-04-03T11:58:00+02:00</updated><author><name>April Wright</name></author><id>tag:wrightaprilm.github.io,2015-04-03:parity-paper.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently submitted a paper I'd like to talk about a little bit. We did a reanalysis of a previously-published dataset from Pyron and Burbrink &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12168/full"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;. This paper assembled a really impressive dataset of squamate parity modes and performed some comparative methods analysis with them. We wanted to look at how phylogenetic uncertainty and model assumptions affect the conclusion reached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I'm writing a little about the reproducibility of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Motivation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Writing This:&lt;/em&gt; A few people have pointed out that open science has kind of an image problem. And I fully agree. From reading Twitter about open science, you'd get the impression that if you don't use the latest tools and your pipeline isn't perfect, and you can't just type 'make' and have the full paper spit back at you from the command line, then you aren't doing it right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not true, and that's a really alienating message. There's a very tech-y modality to a lot of the discussions of open science, but in my experience, a lot of people are quietly and contentedly practicing openness and are &lt;em&gt;really happy&lt;/em&gt; to be nice to new practitioners. I came up in a &lt;a href="http://www.zo.utexas.edu/faculty/antisense/"&gt;lab&lt;/a&gt; where it was expected that you provide everything a person would need to reproduce the paper, even if the journal makes no provisions for that. Lab alums have gone on to release free and open source software prodigiously. Many are involved with generating &lt;a href="http://treethinkers.org"&gt;permissively-licensed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://molevol.mbl.edu/index.php/Main_Page"&gt;fully archived&lt;/a&gt; teaching materials and tutorials. It never occurred to me to do science another way, really. You can do good work, and open work, without breaking your back. This post is fundamentally about &lt;em&gt;striking the right balance for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In using the tools I used:&lt;/em&gt; I had never written a Makefile before and wanted to try. That's all really. I had read about using them for &lt;a href="https://ropensci.org/blog/2014/06/09/reproducibility/"&gt;reproducibility&lt;/a&gt;, and they seemed useful. It's not &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt; reproducibility, in the sense that you type make and are left with a figure, but you type make, get some numbers and use an iPython notebook to plot them. As we simplified the paper, the Makefiles got simpler, so the ones attached to the final paper might actually be basic enough for an intro user to grasp. And I'm all about zero-entry resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html"&gt;iPython Notebook&lt;/a&gt; is a really great tool to make code easy-to-use for collaborators and novices. Since I was working with my labmate, Katie Lyons, who was a total novice at computation, I wanted to make sure the scripts were easy for her to follow. In an iPython notebook, code is held in a cell. The user executes the cell and sees the output. This is especially nice for graphics -  you run your code and your graph shows up, in the window, in full color. You can make very easy-to-see, easy-to-use interactive documents in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What we did&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper had three main analysis:
1) Running &lt;a href="http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~fitzjohn/diversitree.docs/"&gt;BiSSE&lt;/a&gt; on four time-scaled phylogenetic trees to look at the effect of topology and branch length on the conclusions reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Running BiSSE on each of these trees with a variety of parameters to look at the effects of the exact model settings on the conclusion reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Using &lt;a href="http://paup.csit.fsu.edu/"&gt;PAUP&lt;/a&gt; to count changes on the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also little ancillariy analyses that we did, for example, looking at Robinson-Foulds distances between trees. These aren't the main thrust of the paper and are provided as iPython notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goal One: Run BiSSE on a few trees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy enough. We made trees using Examl and garli. The estimations for these trees are quite long - about a week - so we didn't include this step in any of the makefiles. I'm sure I could have beat my head against a wall figuring out a solution to the long estimation problem, but ... well, that really didn't seem worth it. The configuration files for tree-building software can be found in &lt;a href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/ParityPaper/"&gt;our materials&lt;/a&gt; under PhylogenyMaking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we time-scale the trees. Pyron and Burbink used &lt;a href="https://github.com/blackrim/treePL"&gt;treePL&lt;/a&gt; for this and since we're reproducing their work, we did too. TreePL is kind of finicky about where it compiles. I found that using the Linux instructions in a Vagrant box with Ubuntu 12 is the easiest way to do this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't want to bother with these two long steps, the trees are in the Trees directory of the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can run BiSSE in a couple ways, from my repository. The easiest is to open a terminal, change directories into the repository and type 'make'. This will output for you results of BiSSE's parameter fitting as csv files and newick strings of the trees with the marginal likelihoods of ancestral states written to the nodes. You can then visualize these trees in FigTree or your preferred tree-viewing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goal Two: Parameter Sampling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyron and Burbrink used a sampling parameter we weren't sure we understood the function of. So we did an exercise in which we sampled many values of this parameter and made a heatmap to look at how this changed the probability of the ancestor of all squamates being viviparous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you type 'make -f Makefileheat', this analysis will run on your computer. However, it makes a lot of replicates and takes a long time. I wouldn't actually do it. You can find my heatmap data in the Data directory, and the interactive heatmapping script in the iPython notebooks. This script illustrates well what I meant about iPython notebooks being really nice for graphics earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goal Three&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just provided the PAUP file for this. Donezo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How I feel about it&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper was a massive effort. I didn't anticipate how big of an undertaking it would be just to do the research. But I was strongly motivated by pedagogy - a new student in my lab wanted to learn computation, and she really took ownership of this project. She stepped up, and that made it easy for me to step up on a non-dissetation project in my last year of grad school while pregnant.  See her post in the coming days about learning by doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the reproducibility ... I intended to do more. But, right now, I have a paper in review that I'm massively proud of. You can reproduce it. Katie learned a lot. I learned some skills I wanted (make, mostly) and made some resources I think will be helpful for novice users. I'm not a martyr to reproducibility: I'm going to do the best job that I can on it and go home at the end of the day. And that's what I'd like readers, esecially novice readers to take away: your project doesn't need to be perfectly, fully reproducible to be useful. Do your best. Learn something new. Don't get bogged down in the fear that the Twitterverse will chuckle at your puny attempt at a pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do good enough. I did. I deserve a beer. Maybe next month.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Conference Survival</title><link href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/conferences.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-11-10T08:22:00+01:00</updated><author><name>April Wright</name></author><id>tag:wrightaprilm.github.io,2014-11-10:conferences.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I went to the &lt;a href="http://vertpaleo.org/Annual-Meeting/Home.aspx"&gt;SVP annual meetings&lt;/a&gt; last week to do a talk and a &lt;a href="http://phylo.wikidot.com/beastmaster#toc0"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt;. Here are some things that I learned about conferencing internationally while pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I kind of wish I had bought the compression socks for the long flight. But I got up and stretched often and kept hydrated and recovered quickly on the ground. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drinking fountains are not as common in non-US countries, so check ahead if the tapwater is good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pack some saltines. Even though I didn't have morning sickness before leaving, the upset of travel left me a little ill. Wish I had done this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Room snacks. This is what kept me from becoming a monster. I packed nuts, dried fruit and pretzels. Bought plums and yogurt in Berlin. For contrast, hotel breakfast was like 20 bucks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The caffeine limitation is just bad news. Sorry, lady.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schedule important meetings early in the week. If you're ill and can't make it, you still have time to reschedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be proactive about things to which you would like to go versus things to which you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; go. I needed mid-day rest, and found it hard to go to talks immediately after lunch. Everybody's different, and your body is pretty good about telling you what it needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking is harder. I was too tired to be out super late. If you saw a talk, and you liked it, and you know that you'll be immobile by 10 pm, be forward about trying to get together with that person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be focused. When people find out you're pregnant, they might want to talk about their experiences having a kids and ask you questions about the baby. They're happy for you! But if there's something you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; out of that interaction, practice good steering and keep the conversation on track.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relatedly: I'm an open book; I realize not everyone is. Decide what your boundaries are for discussion in a professional setting, and politely defend them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a lot out of this meeting, without feeling like I was stretching myself too thin. Add your own helpful conference stuff in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>SVP 2014 talks and workshops</title><link href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/svp-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-11-10T07:12:00+01:00</updated><author><name>April Wright</name></author><id>tag:wrightaprilm.github.io,2014-11-10:svp-2014.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;All the materials for SVP 2014's total-evidence dating related activities are &lt;a href="http://phylo.wikidot.com/beastmaster"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;So, I'm knocked up on my last year of grad school. There's some great stuff about that (leave, no teaching), and some hard stuff about that (insurance). I'm trying to document some of the things I'm going through and have done, since they might be useful to others. Below I'm putting some meetings that I either had or wish I had had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Before You're Pregnant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR: There are a few things HR can do before you're pregnant. Firstly, if you enroll in short-term disability benefits before you become pregnant, you may be able to use them while on leave. I wish I had done this. It would have kept about a third of a paycheck worth of cash coming in on FMLA.  Secondly, some employers offer a dependent care FSA. UT doesn't, but such programs allow you to use pre-tax dollars to care for a dependent. Usually that's better at tax time than a withholding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're worried about discrimination or a lack of reasonable accommodations for you, you might mention that, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When You're pregnant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University health center: They can confirm a pregnancy and hook you up with a flu shot for free, or close to it. At UT, I saw a nurse named Joyce Fleming, who had a lot of information about the next steps. She helped me figure out what doctors are in my insurance coverage area and who practices at the hospital by my house. If university health care is free and convenient, take advantage of it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR: Get clarification about your insurance benefits. There's probably a deductible and a out-of-pocket cap with your plan. Ask about that. Get a ballpark idea of how much this all might cost, and what appointment co-pays are. Also, at this meeting ask about leave options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I lose coverage two days after my baby is due. COBA via UT is far, far too expensive (about a thousand dollars a month). Stay tuned for my adventures getting enrolled in ACA coverage, which is much cheaper for equivalent care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're having a summer baby, make sure you understand what coverage remains. This may depend on if you were an RA or TA in the spring. Because I'll be on RA, I lose my coverage the day my employment ends (if the baby isn't on time so I can sneak in 11th hour FMLA).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boss: Your boss can help you on a few fronts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're teaching, they might be able to help you find some RA funds for when you're very pregnant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there are any hazards in your work that will require accommodations, you probably want to manage that earlier than later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have field work or strenuous stuff you won't be able to do, your boss can help you sort out how to stay on track to graduate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OB: Settle on a provider and make an appointment. Some providers won't see you until 12 weeks. I went to one where I could get an ultrasound at 8 weeks. Since I've had a pretty asymptomatic pregnancy, this was a sanity saver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dentist: Pregnancy can cause gum issues. Best start tabula rasa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other appointments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specialist doctors: I'm asthmatic, and I've not had any issues. I take a couple hits of albuterol before going running, and it's been fine. But managing special conditions you have is important, so don't forget.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's what I've learned thus far. Tell me what else pregnant grad students should do to care for themselves and their developing young!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Texas Tech Bootcamp</title><link href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/TTU-swc.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-08-30T10:20:00+02:00</updated><author><name>April Wright</name></author><id>tag:wrightaprilm.github.io,2014-08-30:TTU-swc.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Texas Tech Bootcamp&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last weekend, John Fonner and I taught a &lt;a href="http://software-carpentry.org/"&gt;Software Carpentry&lt;/a&gt; bootcamp for scientists in &lt;a href="http://www.ttu.edu/"&gt;Texas Tech's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.atmo.ttu.edu/index.php"&gt;Atmospheric Science&lt;/a&gt; group. I've brought on board &lt;a href="http://www.atmo.ttu.edu/bruning/"&gt;Eric Bruning&lt;/a&gt; to discuss what worked and didn't in the workshop. Overall, evaluations have been really good. But we're all our own worst critics, so, vamanos!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What worked:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of skilled helpers: Eric's crew, Vanna Sullivan, Tony Reinhart and Aaron Hill all know their stuff, which meant learners weren't waiting long for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online resources: We put up most of our material &lt;a href="https://github.com/wrightaprilm/TTU"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;. We had a lot of intermediate and advanced students, but also some novices. This is a tricky balance: we don't want students to be bored, but we don't want to lose the novice tail. At various points, when looking at people's screens, I could see more advanced learners working on testing out supplementary materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands-on time: Particularly during the second day, we gave a lot of time to work through challenges and exercises. This meant we covered less material (we have one notebook that we didn't even get to), but the caliber of question asked by the students indicates that this time was worth it for advancing their understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minute papers: Before leaving for lunch, and before leaving for the day, we did minute papers. On their green stickies, we had students write one thing that worked; on red, one that didn't. These were very helpful. For example, after lunch on the first day, we spent a couple minutes clarifying the dictionary  .keys() method and having a useful discussion about object methods and how to find out which objects have what methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The learners: We had some issues related to pitching the material with multiple levels of learners present. But I think they all had really great attitudes about that, and were aware of those challenges and sought actively to make their own experience worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Novice learners weren't shy about asking questions. The rate of questions was a positive sign that teaching (e.g.) very basic shell was a good idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For many experienced learners version control, unit testing, and classes were still genuinely new ideas. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What didn't:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple levels in one room: I [April] wasn't forceful enough on this, and it came back to bite me. For an intermediate audience, not as much of the 'how-to' is needed on the nuts-and-bolts of programming with Python. For people who know C or Fortran, they can mostly pick up syntax and basics immediately. What they need is the layer on top: testing, sharing, collaborating and code reuse. They can master this particular beast (Python), but they need to control its environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to handle this might be to have a Python I and II session. Python I makes sure we're all on the same page. Python II is mostly practice for novices. During Python II, there could be a breakout covering importing functions as modules, classes, etc. There's a bit of self-selection bias in separating learners that I find worrying, but maybe a checklist of things that qualify learners for an intermediate session could help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related to the first, I [April again] prepped too much material. The week before the bootcamp, I was looking at the responses to the pre-assessment and fipping out just a touch because so many learners seemed so advanced that I was worried we'd fly through everything. We didn't. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But the overage is in an iPython notebook, so learners can walk through this at their leisure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had one disastrous git merge example. That'll learn us for trying to show an example workflow in response to student questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some evidence among the experienced learners of a subset which desired a rules-based, task-focused accretion of skills. They probably would have enjoyed a pretty difficult example, integrating version control and unit testing, drawn from the numpy / matplotlib material. I [Eric] wonder if these students also needed a model workflow for learning from the internet and documentation — for instance, how do you identify an authoritative best-practice once you leave the classroom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, as an organizer, I [Eric] would have liked to have been pushed to engage a bit more to distill my hazy cloud of objectives and desire to serve every learning level. Does the lesson repo have a high-level list of topics and associated teaching times from which I could have assembled a draft schedule? I see this as a tool the instructors could have used to keep me honest about how an actual workshop tends to go.&lt;/p&gt;

And a lot of people have asked in the past couple days what can be done to improve the atmosphere at programming meetings. I&amp;#39;ve been chewing on that pretty substantially.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've had a lot of good discussions over the past couple days (help yourself to warm fuzzies &lt;a href="https://storify.com/WrightingApril/people-are-nice"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).
Reader bioatmosphere made a very good point in the comments, pulled out below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burden to fix things shouldn't be on you just because you're experiencing them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's right, of course. And that reminded me of &lt;a href="http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2014/06/11/another-rant-about-the-pipeline/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/+CateHuston/posts"&gt;Cate Huston&lt;/a&gt;, which closes with a section called "Changing the Conversation". I'll copy the crucial bit (do read the whole thing, though) below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you doing meaningful work? 
Do you feel appreciated? 
Do you feel respected?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I'm going to tack on one more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you feel like you're part of something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I think that's what really got me: I felt like I was part of something, then I didn't. It's not just being snubbed that hurts, it's a sense of loss of a community I kinda thought I fit with.
Since I have some ears bent towards me for a bit: People who feel integrated in communities and happy at meetings, what about it? What about these communities and meetings that makes you feel appreciated? Or respected? Or part of something? And what could you do to help someone else feel that?

I'd never been to a programming conference before, and they featured a lot of education talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I hadn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, at the &lt;a href="http://software-carpentry.org/"&gt;Software Carpentry&lt;/a&gt; mixer, a grand total of 5 men shook my husband's hand and ignored mine. My total of new people met is a dismal ten. Compare it to the &lt;a href="http://evolution2014.org/"&gt;Evolution meetings&lt;/a&gt;, which is 'my' meeting, where I met upwards of 40 new people, had a blast, and was treated by all participants like a member of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of a question my friend &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fineline179"&gt;Steve Young&lt;/a&gt; asked me a while back: "What makes some women stick it out and be awesome [in tech]?" I'm going to turn the question around a bit. It's easy to be 'awesome'. Lots of women are doing 'awesome' things. But I could have sat in my office and worked all week, rather than attending this meeting. I could have done far more 'awesome' alone, and I wouldn't have had my face rubbed in the fact that I'm different. I'd feel a lot less alone had I spent the week hanging out alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the real question is :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What to tech conferences have to offer to diverse participants?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, I hate the term 'diverse participants'. It doesn't make sense, as a term. And I'm not diverse. I'm middle class, educated, straight and white like almost anyone else at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was crying myself to sleep last night, my husband asked me a very good question: 'Why do you hang out with these people?'. And I don't have an answer for that. I don't really know what I expected. I know tech is really sexist; I've heard all the anecdotes and seen the numbers and figures. But we have such good female participation at UT in our &lt;a href="https://github.com/wrightaprilm/BioComputing2014"&gt;course&lt;/a&gt;. I guess I thought I could be different and I could make this be fun and exciting. I'm young and naive and bull-headed and I thought I could break the mold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course I couldn't. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's the kicker. I didn't have a good time and I won't be attending future programming conferences, unless they're explicitly for women. I have no incentive to. I didn't feel lonely as a pythonista until this week. I didn't feel like I didn't belong before this week. Before this week, I had a lot of friends who like what I'm doing and think I'm cool. Now I know that's an isolated thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I go to the Evolution meetings, I'm greeted by people like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nhcooper123"&gt;Natalie Cooper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/phylorich"&gt;Rich FitzJohn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trayc7"&gt;Tracy Heath&lt;/a&gt; who are eager to reach down and help people up. People who make opportunities and build communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In programming, I'm greeted by people who don't want to shake my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This year, SciPy had a &lt;a href="https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/code_of_conduct/"&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;, which is great. And there was a women in science luncheon, which was also good, if too short to allow actual networking and conversation. I do think there are some good people working on this issue, and maybe it'll be better in the future. But I have a strong prior against that change being big enough to get me to come back.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>CCBB Wrap-Up</title><link href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/ccbb-wrap.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-05-22T04:40:00+02:00</updated><author><name>April Wright</name></author><id>tag:wrightaprilm.github.io,2014-05-22:ccbb-wrap.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week was the CCBB's first ever Big Data in Biology summer school. I was the Python instructor. 4x3-hour-days, 16 students. Fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What worked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Topics: I think we had a good covering of what really matters in programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red/Green stickies: Red sticky on laptop = trouble, green = all good. Really efficient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bite-sized materials. I largely did one markdown document per topic (one on Pandas importing and slicing, one on missing data filtration and replacement, one on plotting). Helped keep me on track, ensure exercise breaks and keep the schedule moving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating testing: I think by-and-large, most people were comfortable with the logic of self-skepticism by the end of the course, even if we didn't get to actual formal testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Class size: We never had so many people to help that two of us couldn't manage efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What didn't:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installs: I know other instructors don't support Windows, and it's tempting to just give up. I do feel like GitBash is a big help on this front, but working at the interpreter in iPython was persistently a problem. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying to go off-script: I should really know by now that if I go off-script and something doesn't work out, I will get mad flustered. But I don't know this. And I try it all the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutral:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Git: Still kind of much for novices. Since this was a Python course, we more-or-less used it to disseminate materials. I'm not sure I would do try this way of managing materials again without a full session on Git. But ... multiple people had started their own repos for personal scripts and were pushing to them by the end of the workshop. So unclear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The room: It was nice, I think the temperature was generally nice, and it had appropriate hook-ups for my computer. Screen mirroring had a slick set-up, too. But power strips were an issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The schedule: There was some pretty obvious fatigue, particularly among students who were taking morning classes by the end. Not sure how to manage this, because I do think all the stuff we went over was important. I saved regex for the last day, since those are easy to visually understand via RegexPal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I had a good time. We'll see in a couple weeks what the students thought.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>CCBB Day One</title><link href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/day-one.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-05-19T11:15:00+02:00</updated><author><name>April Wright</name></author><id>tag:wrightaprilm.github.io,2014-05-19:day-one.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What worked&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Base Python: People generally found Python intuitive*   Hands-On: We did a lot of hands-on (about 25 minute per hour, plus a break every hour and a half)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minute papers: We  got a lot of good feedback from these&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What didn't&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installs: A few people hadn't installed things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Git: I think this was a little much for first thing for total novices, but we mostly got this working&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got turned around and a bit flustered with helping people in the start, getting everyone used to the course website + etherpad. I still get flustered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's up tomorrow:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syncing course repos with personal, and pushing a first bit of text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviewing exercises from yesterday&lt;/li&gt;

And I've realized one thing: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experiences with sexual harassment have shaped the scientist I am and the mentor I want to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've known for a long time this is a big thing for me. It wasn't until I started drafting research statements that I realized how strongly I feel on this particular topic, not as an aside to my work, but as a cornerstone of it. If you've navigated here because I've linked you, or the Hillis Lab site has linked you, you need to know this:
Inclusivity is foundational to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outreach has been important to me. As I move through each stage of a leaky pipeline, outreach and mentoring will only become more important. 
I grew up being a sci-fi geek. I was 'one of the guys' by virtue of liking the things I did. At every transition in my life, I've learned that I'm not alone, but that other women were tired of harassment or weirdness and didn't pursue those interests. I feel like I've tolerated a lot of garbage because, from youth, I've expected to be treated that way. If there's anything I've taken from the past few years in graduate school, it's that there are women who want to be academics, and for a variety of reasons, feel unwelcome. And for a skilled young person, the incentive to stick around when your treatment is unfair is tiny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got into the clubhouse. I'm going to help other people in. And that's an inextricable part of who I am.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Test-Driven Development for Novices</title><link href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/CCBB.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-05-10T12:27:00+02:00</updated><author><name>April Wright</name></author><id>tag:wrightaprilm.github.io,2014-05-10:CCBB.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Ch-ch-changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've mentioned in passing before that the &lt;a href="http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/"&gt;CCBB&lt;/a&gt; is ramping up its &lt;a href="http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/training.html"&gt;course offerings&lt;/a&gt;. One of the new offerings is the &lt;a href="http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/summerschool.html"&gt;Big Data in Biology Summer School&lt;/a&gt;. I'm instructing a Python &lt;a href="http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/summerschool.html#Python"&gt;session&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to try some new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teaching to the test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also teach testing in our working group. But it generally comes in quite late, and I've never been super pleased about this. This time around, we're going to start right away with some testing lite. No libraries, just some simple one function, one test programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no reason that even a novice programmer can't do test-driven development. If you want your function to return whole numbers to be used in a later computation, anyone can do a simple check that their output is made of integers. If you're looking to return a value between zero and one, that's easy to check, as well. There's no reason to hold off on integrating the logic of unit testing: What &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be true about this output for it to be usable? What must be true about my input for my computation to function?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple data checking is something that is easy to implement early and often. Self-skepticism about our results is a skill I can either build or scare into students. Actual testing libraries can be covered at the end of the course. Not that anyone is going to use them, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan is that for the first exercises, there are no tests. Then, I'll ask them to add a simple test of something specific (such as, add a line of code that ensures your output is a number, and prints a nasty message if it isn't). On the next assignment, I'll leave it more vague (Decide what must be true about the output of your function and test it). And lastly, the training wheels come off and I tell them to test as appropriate in their script. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I can pull this off. Is anyone else teaching test-driven development for novices?&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Hello Ladies</title><link href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/hello-ladies.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-05-03T02:20:00+02:00</updated><author><name>April Wright</name></author><id>tag:wrightaprilm.github.io,2014-05-03:hello-ladies.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I blog a lot about the course that I co-run. One thing i haven't blogged extensively about is the students themselves. I've noticed as the semester goes on, our course becomes more female. We started out with about a 50-50 sex ratio in the room. As we moved through basic Python section of the course and into the "special topics" part, that ratio changed pretty dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women came to a lot more sessions than men. Just doing cursory headcounts, by the end of basic Python, about three-quarters of attendees were female. In our session on high-performance cluster computing with TACC, there was one lone dude in the a room full of women (besides Ben, my co-instructor, and Benni, the guy teaching the session). Same story in this week's local BLAST session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why do women come to more classes than men?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few hypotheses about what's going on here, and I'd like feedback for how to test these. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hypothesis one:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing to see here; it's a fluke. My inclination is that this is unlikely to be true. I couldn't find specific stats on the sex ratios in all of the graduate programs that from which students come, but overall, the College of Natural Science &lt;a href="http://www.utexas.edu/academic/ima/sites/default/files/RPT_ENRL_FA11_HDCE_HCbyDisc_Class_Eth_Gender.pdf"&gt;skews male&lt;/a&gt;. Most of our students are from the Evolution, Ecology and Behavior program, and the Institute of Cell and Molecular biology. These departments have more equal sex ratios, and EEB leans towards female-majority. But I wouldn't expect the aggregate of these departments to produce as strong a female bias as is observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hypothesis two:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's been a lot made of the confidence gap. [&lt;em&gt;Ed. Note&lt;/em&gt;: I don't love the term because the confidence gap is caused by sexism and unequal treatment of women, and it seems like talking about this gap talks around the root cause.] Is it possible that women perceive themselves to be less capable of self-instruction than men?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hypothesis three:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do men come to graduate school with more of a computational background than women? It's not a secret that there are &lt;a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/women-gain-in-some-stem-fields-but-not-computer-science/?_php=true_type=blogs_r=0"&gt;fewer female computer science bachelor's earners than male&lt;/a&gt;. But we're not instructing computer scientists. We're instructing biologists. And it's far slipperier to get your hands on data about how many biologists receive training in computer science. Research by &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/articles/285/"&gt;Barraquand et al.&lt;/a&gt; suggests that training in overall quantitative topics is considered inadequate by many ecologists. A look over the getting to know you survey that we did did at the beginning of the course suggests that men and women come to our working group with similar levels of experience. My feeling is, therefore, that this is unlikely to be true. But it's possible that men had an overall higher familiarity with programming as a discipline feel that they need less training. Could be an interaction between this hypothesis and hypothesis two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hypothesis four:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women seek training more because they feel they need it to get ahead. I know, personally, that I've sought out formal training in the past because I felt that I wouldn't be taken seriously, as a woman, unless I had some sort of seal-of-approval verifying my skills. I see no reason that this would be untrue for other women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hypothesis five:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our course environment might be more conducive to women's comfort. Half our instructional staff (but not our guest speaker line-up) is female. I'm pretty outspokenly feminist. We're not scary like some of the computer science people are. Ben and I are good friends, most of the guest speakers are my friends, the (female) TA is my friend. And I'll personally vouch for their character. None of us will grope or sexually harass students (like I've been by a teaching assistant in the course of my computational education). It's been recently suggested that women don't go into tech because &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/technology/technologys-man-problem.html?smid=tw-share"&gt;the men in tech are jerks&lt;/a&gt;. I think there's something to this, and the fact that we aren't creepy jerks might be helping us out here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/End spitballing&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to apply some data to this problem. I've currently got some feelers out for people who study this type of thing. If you know someone who works on this type of research, or are someone works on this type of research, get in touch! I'd love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Parsing Evaluations</title><link href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/pars-ev.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-04-26T12:42:00+02:00</updated><author><name>April Wright</name></author><id>tag:wrightaprilm.github.io,2014-04-26:pars-ev.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;So some people said some stuff about a thing you taught&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few weeks, I've been reading and ruminating on course evaluations that we got from this round of our biocomputing &lt;a href="https://github.com/wrightaprilm/BioComputing2014"&gt;working group&lt;/a&gt;. Previous post introducing the course is &lt;a href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/first_half.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and my thoughts on writing a good evaluation is &lt;a href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/evals.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We changed the course a lot since last year based on evaluations. The big change is that we added homework, which many students requested. What we wanted to learn is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do students enjoy about the class?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do they not like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can we do to support learning?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's take a look at the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We moved both too fast and too slow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's wide variance in whether the course moved too fast. Novices think it did, more experienced people think it didn't. Hardly a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What this suggests&lt;/em&gt;: There is some demand in the UT community for intermediate Python. I'm not super shocked at this, as there's no real formal curriculum for learning specific languages at UT (beyond a CS course that is literally impossible for non-CS majors to enroll in). The &lt;a href="http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/"&gt;CCBB&lt;/a&gt; is ramping up its &lt;a href="http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/training.html"&gt;training programs&lt;/a&gt; and there might be some room there for development of courses that assume a higher baseline of knowledge and cover more breadth.
*   Homework helps. So do code fragments. Students who looked at code outside of class, did homework and reviewed notes are more confident in their ability to complete programming tasks on their own or with a little Google. Hardly a revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What this suggests&lt;/em&gt;: We currently exist outside of any sort of incentive structure. We can't give credit, nor can we levy consequences for not doing your homework. If we're going to continue to operate outside the normal academic structure, we need to find some way to       motivate students to think about this material outside of class. Perhaps some sort of certificate?
*   Students who need to use programming for their work learned more stuff. It's very clear that "I need to graduate someday" or "I don't wanna post-doc forever" are great motivators. But early-stage graduate students (who have the time to be in class) don't have the data to apply their learning off the bat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What this suggests&lt;/em&gt;: We considered making it mandatory to have a data set that you're working with to join our class/support group. But we have no way of enforcing this. I think the thing to do is to make a bank of example data sets, and assign people without data a buddy and a dataset. Part of the homework could be to apply some aspect of the class material to the fake data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People love Python, Pandas and in-class exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What this suggests&lt;/em&gt;: #Pythonista4Life. Also, perhaps we should switch to a two-hour session. Right now, we do a 1.5-hour session. We talk about some topic for about a half-hour to 45 minutes, and then take an exercise application break. Then we talk some more.     Perhaps we could switch to a format with two half-hour talk sessions, and two half-hour exercise breaks.
*   We were mostly good on jargon, except when we weren't. Most students said that we didn't use jargon and that they didn't feel lost very often. A couple students have a more expansive definition of jargon, including concepts like loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What this suggests&lt;/em&gt;: I'm not really sure. There are some words you just have to know if you want to do programming. We generally       provide some kind of &lt;a href="https://github.com/wrightaprilm/BioComputing2014/blob/master/lesson_2/CheatSheet.md"&gt;cheatsheet&lt;/a&gt; with lessons.        There's a hard floor on how simple we can make things, and I think we've about hit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's the five-cent tour of our survey results, folks. Overall, we did well this year, in particular since we had some tough circumstances towards the start of the year (two lectures lost due to snow days). I feel positive about our evaluation format, as well. We got the information that we set out to get, and now we know what to work on for next year. I'll definitely be using these evaluation forms again. I don't want to share results publicly, since some are signed, but ping me if you want to talk in more depth about evaluations and results.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Wrighting Evaluations</title><link href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/evals.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-04-07T04:15:00+02:00</updated><author><name>April Wright</name></author><id>tag:wrightaprilm.github.io,2014-04-07:evals.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a lot of readers may know, I teach a biological computing course, with my labmate Ben. We're a weird little entity: we're endorsed by the university's &lt;a href="http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/semesterlong.html"&gt;Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics&lt;/a&gt;. We can't offer course credit, nor can we incentivize participation. This creates a really odd dynamic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students can come learn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;*   But they have to be self-motivated
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students can get code feedback&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;*   But they&amp;#39;re putting in their own time and receiving no credit
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students can come hang out and get to know the UT biological programming community&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;*   But again, this is time out of their day
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We break our semester into two halves. As you can see on our &lt;a href="https://github.com/wrightaprilm/BioComputing2014"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;, there's a bit of basic python for the first few sessions. The second half is made up of speakers from the UT community coming to talk about how they use computation to make their work easier, faster, more reproducible, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also invite people for beer. To foster community, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's our intro course. We're sending out the evaluation surveys for the first half of the class in a bit here, so I'll be back with some analytics on retention in a couple weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>SSC Wrap-Up</title><link href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/SSC-wrap.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-02-25T09:15:00+01:00</updated><author><name>April Wright</name></author><id>tag:wrightaprilm.github.io,2014-02-25:SSC-wrap.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Thanks so much to all the participants in the SSC spring Python short course&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;(And maybe a better person)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know me, probably something you know about me is that I like to teach. 
Happiness is nothing if not shared; I like to share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people ask me why I think that teaching is so much. And at the end of 
the day, the only thing I can really tell them is that the world is big. Really 
big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mindbogglingly big it is. 
(If we're going to start this blog with a positive jam, let's go to the big man
himself.) 
There's something incredibly satisfying about seeing the lights go on and the 
wheels start to turn when someone gets their first loop. As an academic, my life
is pretty often an exercise in delayed gratification. But when you've done a 
good job teaching, your student goes from a pupil to a &lt;em&gt;colleague&lt;/em&gt;. That's 
powerful stuff. Makes my day, right there. 
Of course, there's also the altruistic stuff: you helped someone get to where
they needed to be, you're helping them make a better project. But feeling good
keeps you coming back. 
But if you're not convinced, I've compiled a list of reasons why teaching skills
(not just programming - could be any skill) to novices helps us all be better:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a more articulate person for having to break ideas down into bite-sized
pieces 
+I am a more patient person for helping someone take their first steps. 
+I am a more conscientious programmer for seeing all the creative solutions
my students-cum-colleagues come up with. 
+I'm better at documenting code, knowing someone who needs help might read it. 
+I actually kind of like the sound of my own voice. That's something I never
would have said when I started graduate school. &lt;/li&gt;
