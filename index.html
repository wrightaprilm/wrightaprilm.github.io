            <article>
                <p>I went to SciPy this week. I'd never been to a programming conference before, and they featured a lot of education talks. </p>
<p>I wish I hadn't.</p>
<p>Last night, at the <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> mixer, a grand total of 5 men shook my husband's hand and ignored mine. My total of new people met is a dismal ten. Compare it to the <a href="http://evolution2014.org/">Evolution meetings</a>, which is 'my' meeting, where I met upwards of 40 new people, had a blast, and was treated by all participants like a member of the community.</p>
<p>I was reminded of a question my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/fineline179">Steve Young</a> asked me a while back: "What makes some women stick it out and be awesome [in tech]?" I'm going to turn the question around a bit. It's easy to be 'awesome'. Lots of women are doing 'awesome' things. But I could have sat in my office and worked all week, rather than attending this meeting. I could have done far more 'awesome' alone, and I wouldn't have had my face rubbed in the fact that I'm different. I'd feel a lot less alone had I spent the week hanging out alone.</p>
<p>I think the real question is :</p>
<h2>What do tech conferences have to offer to diverse participants?</h2>
<p>For the record, I hate the term 'diverse participants'. It doesn't make sense, as a term. And I'm not diverse. I'm middle class, educated, straight and white like almost anyone else at the meeting.</p>
<p>As I was crying myself to sleep last night, my husband asked me a very good question: 'Why do you hang out with these people?'. And I don't have an answer for that. I don't really know what I expected. I know tech is really sexist; I've heard all the anecdotes and seen the numbers and figures. But we have such good female participation at UT in our <a href="https://github.com/wrightaprilm/BioComputing2014">course</a>. I guess I thought I could be different and I could make this be fun and exciting. I'm young and naive and bull-headed and I thought I could break the mold. </p>
<p>And of course I couldn't. </p>
<p>And that's the kicker. I didn't have a good time and I won't be attending future programming conferences, unless they're explicitly for women. I have no incentive to. I didn't feel lonely as a pythonista until this week. I didn't feel like I didn't belong before this week. Before this week, I had a lot of friends who like what I'm doing and think I'm cool. Now I know that's an isolated thing.</p>
<p>When I go to the Evolution meetings, I'm greeted by people like <a href="https://twitter.com/nhcooper123">Natalie Cooper</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/phylorich">Rich FitzJohn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/trayc7">Tracy Heath</a> who are eager to reach down and help people up. People who make opportunities and build communities. </p>
<p>In programming, I'm greeted by people who don't want to shake my hand.</p>
<p>Note: This year, SciPy had a <a href="https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/code_of_conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>, which is great. And there was a women in science luncheon, which was also good, if too short to allow actual networking and conversation. I do think there are some good people working on this issue, and maybe it'll be better in the future. But I have a strong prior against that change being big enough to get me to come back.</p>
